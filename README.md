# Advanced React Session 2

## Step 1

Create a `NetworkStatusProvider`, that will give the ability to read what's the user's current network status and prevent the users from marking a Pokemon as caught when they are offline.

## Step 2

Create a clear separation between the presentational components and container components. Create the components if you think they are missing.

## Step 3

Extract the data fetching and loading placeholder from `Pokemons` component to an HoC named `withLoader`.

## Step 4

Create a Modal using the Compound Component pattern and fetch Pokemon data in that modal.  
The `PokemonModal` component is ready for you to just set as the content.
