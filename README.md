# Advanced React Session 2

To start, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.

## Step 1

Create a `NetworkStatusProvider`, that will give the ability to read what's the user's current network status and prevent the users from marking a Pokemon as caught when they are offline.

## Step 2

Create a `withNetworkStatus` HoC that will wrap the component with a provider.

## Step 3

Use component composition to create a Layout component with the shared parts.

## Step 4

Create a Modal using the Compound Component pattern and fetch Pokemon data in that modal.  
The `PokemonModal` component is ready for you to just set as the content.
